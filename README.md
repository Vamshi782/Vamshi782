## 🧠 Who I Am

<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Vamshi782&show_icons=true&theme=tokyonight&hide_border=true&count_private=true&bg_color=0d1117" width="400"/>

I'm a **Data Analytics graduate student at Northeastern University's Roux Institute** (Portland, ME / Boston, MA) with hands-on industry experience at the intersection of **data engineering, machine learning, and decision intelligence**.

I've spent the last 3+ years solving real problems:

- 🧬 At **Solid Biosciences**, I built an AI-powered analytics platform from scratch that transformed how scientists interpret bioreactor data — cutting a 6-hour manual process down to 45 minutes
- 🏥 At **Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital**, I built executive dashboards and SQL pipelines across a 500+ bed facility, improving reporting consistency by 18%
- 📐 At **Northeastern**, I'm maintaining a **3.8 GPA** while applying everything in coursework covering ML, data engineering, privacy, and business analytics

I don't just build models — I build **things that get used**.
